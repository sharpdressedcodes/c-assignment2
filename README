Any other notes for the marker:

Bonus 1:
I used a function pointer as an iteration callback for ItemTypePtr types.
Look inside bcs_utility.c around line 1700 at the eachItem() method.

Bonus 2:
I have made 3 projects (well only 1 but used Git to create other branches).
The first version incorporates both normal linked lists and generic linked lists
using #ifdef BONUS_2 wherever required. I prefer this way because you only
need to maintain 1 project and don't duplicate code.

The second version is the normal version without any generic linked lists, or the bonus 2.
The third version is the Bonus 2 version (using generic linked lists instead of hard coded ones).

All 3 projects are exactly the same. So if you just look at project 1, you won't need to look at
the other 2 (Just go into bcs.h and comment out #define BONUS_2 true, then recompile).
Likewise, if you don't want to view the first project, you will have to view
both project 2 and 3 to see the full code.

I have been asked to describe where the bonus 2 is located, and it is pretty much throughout
the whole project. The main changes are in bcs.h, bcs_utility.h, bcs_utility.c and bcs_options.c.
I think everything is pretty straight forward (but that's probably because I made it) so if you
have any questions about this please feel free to contact me for verification.
